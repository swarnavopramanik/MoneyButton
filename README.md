<h4 align="center">MoneyButton is a wallet that gives us access to the BSV blockchain of the Bitcoin network. It is completely without custody, so we are in charge of the “keys”, coins and financial sovereignty. MoneyButton works wonderfully as a peer payment tool with a simple and functional interface and a very easy to learn interface: we enter an address and swipe to pay. Simple . </h4>

## 🚀 About 

It was just the tool that I was looking for and that although I tried to use Ethereum at the beginning for it, the truth is that with Bitcoin SV I am now happier since it does not have the whole roll of Gas and in the end the issue of donations tokens not It is necessary, with Digital Cash is enough. I have also been able to see that MoneyButton buttons can make payment distribution in several accounts at the same time, something that can be very useful for example, in the world of intellectual property and music distribution.
